Extending OpenPGPCard implementation for JavaCard
-------------------------------------------------

Our objective is to maintain protocol compatibility with OpenPGP Card
(to remain compatible with existing programs) and extend it with
features that we miss.

Our work is based on JCOpenPGP by Peter Chovanec.
